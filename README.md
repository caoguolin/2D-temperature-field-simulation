# 2D-temperature-field-simulation
The finite difference method is used to solve the simulation of two-dimensional unsteady temperature field


This script aims to simulate the change of the two-dimensional temperature field with time. 
The solution used is the finite difference method, and the method of solving the finite difference equation is the direct iteration method.


The final result is mainly some images, including the simulation of the cooling process of nodes in different regions at a given temperature, and the comparison of the cooling process of nodes in different regions at different initial temperatures.

At the same time, the three-dimensional wireframes of the temperature field distribution of the objects at the start time, the middle time, and the end time are also drawn.

The program contains a total of 17 comments, which can be eaten with confidence (*^_^*)
